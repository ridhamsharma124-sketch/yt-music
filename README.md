# yt-music
I developed a YouTube Music Clone using React.js, focusing on building a responsive and interactive music player interface. The project includes a clean UI similar to YouTube Music, where users can browse songs, play tracks, control audio, and navigate between sections.
Used useState for handling UI state
useEffect for syncing audio events and updating progress.
Routing: Implemented using React Router (Home, Library, Playlist pages).
Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
Tools: VS Code, GitHub, JSON data for songs
